Tomb Escape is a simple, short game I made before university in unreal where you are plunged into a tomb and have to try and escape. You find that you have an ability to see things that aren't there which is called ancient vision (press R).
You can also pick up objects with left click.

There is also a video if you would like to view that instead.

NOTE: apologies but I realise that there is no way to exit the game when it is running and you have to shift - tab out I would change it but the project is on a depreciated version of unreal, if I can get an updated version of the executable on this repository I will. If you're viewing this and that is not the case then my apologies for the inconvenience.
