Tomb Escape is a simple, short game I made before university in unreal where you are plunged into a tomb and have to try and escape. You find that you have an ability to see things that aren't there which is called ancient vision (press R).
You can also pick up objects with left click.

There is an executable linked on MEGA, if you would rather have the original uproject contact me on ambroser53@gmail.com

There is also a video if you would like to view that instead.

NOTE: apologies but I realise that there is no way to exit the game when it is running and you have to shift - tab out. I've tried changing it but the project was originally created on a depreciated version of unreal, and cannot be repackaged due to lighting issues. 
If I can get an updated version of the executable on this repository I will. If you're viewing this and that is not the case then my apologies for the inconvenience.
